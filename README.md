# CoinKeeper - Personal Finance Manager

**CoinKeeper** is a fullâ€”featured web-based personal finance management application developed as an analog of the popular CoinKeeper service. It allows users to track their income and expenses, manage accounts and categories, and analyze their financial activity using visual charts.

The project consists of two main parts:
1. **Backend**: REST API on Node.js and Express, which uses JSON files as data storage.
2.  **Frontend (CoinKeeper)**: A single-page SPA application on React using Redux for state management and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Key features

### User Management:
* **Registration and Authentication**: Secure registration of new users and login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
* **Profile Management**: Users can view and update their profile information (name, email).
* **Password change**: The ability to change the account password.
* **Account Deletion**: Users can delete their account.

### Financial accounting:
* **Account Management**:
* Creation, reading, updating and deletion (CRUD) of bank accounts, wallets, etc.
    * Specify the initial balance, icons and colors for each account.
    * Automatic calculation of the current account balance based on transactions.
* **Category Management**:
* CRUD operations for income and expense categories.
    * Customize icons and colors for each category.
    * View the total turnover by category.
* **Transaction Management**:
    * Adding, reading, updating and deleting transactions (income/expenses).
    * Linking transactions to an account and category.
    * Specify the amount, date, and comment.
    *   Filtering transactions by account, category, type (income/expense) and date.
    * Pagination for the transaction list.

### Analytics and mapping:
* **Total Balance**: Displays the user's total balance across all accounts.
* **Statistics**:
    *   Visualization of income and expenses by category using pie charts.
    * Comparative bar chart of income and expenses by category.
    *   Filtering data on the statistics page by date and category.
* **Currency Conversion**: Displays balances and transactions in a user-selected currency (KZT, RUB, USD, EUR) using predefined exchange rates.

### Settings:
* **Application Settings**: Select the primary currency to display.
* **Help**: Help section (currently under development).

## Project launch

### Backend:
1. Go to the 'backend` directory.
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the server:
    * For development with automatic restart: `npm run dev`
    * For production: `npm start`
    The default server will be running on `http://localhost:8080 `.

### Frontend (CoinKeeper):
1. Go to the `CoinKeeper` directory.
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Launch the development application: `npm run dev`
    The app will be available on `http://localhost:5173 ` (or another port specified by Vite).
